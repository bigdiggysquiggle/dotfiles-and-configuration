# i3blocks configuration file

# The i3blocks man page describes the usage of the binary,
# and its website describes the configuration:

#     https://vivien.github.io/i3blocks

# TODO:
#	Verify the current blocks function as expected
#	Decide if some of these need separate actions for when they're clicked on
#	Figure out if it's possible to have a regular command and a click command in the same block
#	Integrate font-awesome icons
