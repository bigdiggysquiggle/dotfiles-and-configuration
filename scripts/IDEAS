An ongoing list of things to play with in order to beef up my scripting skills

Renaming filenames from upper -> lower case. Newsgroup posters are so goddamn inconsiderate sometimes!

What I think is also useful to know is which unix programs to use in which situations. These examples should help

Use sed to replace and insert text into an XML file
Use find to perform an action on every file that matches some criteria (this would lead on to the backup script)
Use lsof to find all connections to a certain port open longer than 24 hours and kill them.
